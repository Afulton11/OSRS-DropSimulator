# OSRS-DropSimulator
A tool for osrs that approximates loot you may get from anything that drops/gives loot in oldschool runescape.
While not entirely accurate, It still is fun to see what you might get.
# How to Use
Simply type the name of the npc in the *top box* and the amount of times to 'kill' the npc in the box below it.
Then click on set loot.

The boxes are denoted by tooltip texts that can be seen by hovering over each one.

# Finding Acceptable Names
As long as the name you type in to the *npc box* is spelled correctly, the npc you were looking up should be found. The Drop Simulator generates a wiki link corresponding to the name you typed in. If the npc isn't found the npc may not be on the osrs wiki!
